This POC showcases how we can internally use tailwind (or some other build time css tool), have the benefit of a scoped css reset, and allow targeting descriptor classnames, which always override our own styles. A prop to pass classnames to specific elements and a nice internal DX to apply styles and targetable descriptor classnames is also included.

Make sure to open via the `.vscode/project.code-workspace` file if using vscode.

Run `npm run dev` to start.
